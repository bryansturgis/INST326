Week 1: This week me and my team used AI to get many ideas on what we should do for our final project because we had some interests but did not know what direction we should go with it. Chat GPT gave us many good options to consider or branch our own ideas from: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c36587-a6b4-800e-a2bf-5a68f507622f


Week 2: This week while brainstorming ideas I came up with one that could be great for our project.
I was thinking of something that rated off-campus housing options and gave the rental a score based on a few factors
I gave ChatGPT my idea by telling it this: "What about something that can help university of Maryland students. Something with finding rentals. Ideas: Find best pricing pulling data such as distance from classes Providing a score for the distance of food, grocery or things to do Etc"
It then provided me alot of different routes me and my team could go with this project and how they could fit into the scope of the project.
I presented my team with the idea and why it could be good and they said we should do that, we then started brainstorming different ideas we could do.
After our ideas were on the google doc we used Chat GPT to help improve our ideas and tie them together.

Week 3:
While attempting to get data on rental properties in the college park area I asked ChatGPT and Grok if they could scrape the data from the platform we needed data from
and it was not able to accomplish this task. We will find more ways we use AI when we can to help us save time on various tedius tasks.

Week 4:
I was having issues with exersize 10 on the Week 4 exersises so I asked chat gpt what I was wrong with my code, it was not able to help with a solution so I then asked grok and it was not able to help either. They both said their was an issue with the test code and I was not sure what to do for that problem.

I also used AI to help me get some ideas for a wireframe for the project. I want to do the wireframe using figma and it was able to create me a starting figma file I will fine tune it and implement some of my UX experience from past projects to determine how the website will flow for users.

Week 5:
This week I used AI in order to piece together functions and make them more strategic.
I had a good idea of what functions our project needed but I just needed it mapped out so I could best decide
the functions to work on first in order to utilize them most effectively.

I also needed help with a function that retrieved geographic coordinates based off the input of an address.
AI helped me learn how to implement this pretty simple function that would have taken a lot longer to create without AI.

I also was using Figma and noticed Figma make, its an AI Figma has and it help create an amazing working wireframe. I entered in all of
our project info and some more ideas of what I wanted into chat GPT and it designed me the best prompt to give figma. I then pasted that into
Figma make and it designed us the best wireframe I could've ever imagined. We will be making edits to it, but this definitly gives us design ideas I can implement using HTML and CSS
